# Artificial Intelligence Assignment (50%) 2018  

## *Using Simulated Annealing to Break a Playfair Cipher*  

You are required to use the simulated annealing algorithm to break a Playfair Cipher. Your
application should have the following minimal set of features:  
- A menu-driven command line UI that enables a cipher-text source to be specified (a
file or URL) and an output destination file for decrypted plain-text.  
- Decrypt cipher-text with a simulated annealing algorithm that uses a log-probability
and n-gram statistics as a heuristic evaluation function.
